Knotted protein unfolding
====

Knotted proteins are generally topologically more complex than unknotted proteins of similar polypeptide sequence length. Additionally, knotted proteins have a diverse topology with different levels of complexity. Four distinct knot types have been detected in proteins, namely, trefoil, 31, figure-of-eight, 41, three-twist, 52, and stevedore, 61. So far, I have studied a protein with the simplest topology, a trefoil (31) knot. I plan to expand our work to proteins with higher topological complexity. We hypothesize that these proteins will also be less flexible than their unknotted counterparts.
In my previous MD simulations, I used the Gromacs software package and I plan to use it again in the study of the other types of knots. Due to the complexity of the potential energy surface (PES) related to the systems I will simulate, regular MD is not a practical method. To overcome the high-energy barriers along the PES I will employ an accelerated MD method called metadynamics. For this type of simulation, I will use another software, called PLUMED, in conjunction with Gromacs.
