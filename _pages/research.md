Knotted protein unfolding
====
Knotted proteins have been identified in approximately 1% of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries
Knotted proteins are generally topologically more complex than unknotted proteins of similar polypeptide sequence lengths. Additionally, knotted proteins have a diverse topology with different levels of complexity. Four distinct knot types have been detected in proteins: trefoil, 3~1~, figure-of-eight, 4^2, three-twist, and stevedore knots, We seek to better understand how the presence of a molecular knot affects a protein's unfolding mechanism compared to a similar unknotted protein. We To overcome the high-energy barriers along the free energy surface (FES) of these proteins we use metadynamics. 

  
Water filtration through Graphynes’ Pores
====

Graphyne is a carbon allotrope formed by sp and sp2 carbon atoms. It is a 2D material, similar to graphene, however, it presents different types depending on number of triple bonds connecting benzene rings. By increasing the number of triple bonds, it is possible to form pores of various sizes. Molecular dynamic (MD) studies [1,2] showed that graphyne pores can be used for water purification technologies. However, their study relied on empirical force fields. To consider quantum mechanical effects we used density functional tight binding (DFTB) to describe the electronic structure of these systems. Our MD simulations are accelerated with the aid of the MetaD method. ﻿This study was performed using the DFTB+ and PLUMED packages.
