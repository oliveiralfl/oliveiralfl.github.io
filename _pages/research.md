Knotted protein unfolding
====
Knotted proteins have been identified in approximately 1% of the protein data bank entries. Knotted proteins are generally topologically more complex than unknotted proteins of similar polypeptide sequence lengths. Additionally, they have a diverse topology with different levels of complexity. Four distinct knot types have been detected in proteins: trefoil, 3<sub>1</sub>, figure-of-eight, 4<sub>1</sub>, three-twist, 5<sub>2</sub>, and stevedore, 6<sub>1</sub>, knots. In this project, we seek to better understand how the presence of a molecular knot affects a protein's unfolding mechanism compared to a similar unknotted protein. To accomplish this we are studying the free energy surface (FES) of the unfolding/unknotting as a function of the fraction of native contacts. To overcome the high-energy barriers along the free energy surface (FES) of these proteins we use metadynamics.

Water filtration through Graphynes’ Pores
====

Graphyne is a carbon allotrope formed by sp and sp<sup>2</sup> carbon atoms. It is a 2D material, similar to graphene, however, it presents different types depending on the number of triple bonds connecting benzene rings. By increasing the number of triple bonds, it is possible to form pores of various sizes. Molecular dynamic (MD) studies showed that graphyne pores can be used for water purification technologies. However, their study relied on empirical force fields. To consider quantum mechanical effects we use density functional tight binding (DFTB) to describe the electronic structure of these systems. Our MD simulations are accelerated with the aid of the MetaD method. ﻿This study is performed using the DFTB+ and PLUMED packages.

Also shown is the setup for exploratory metadynamics simulations. We combined six units of graphyne-6 and placed a water cluster with 32 water molecules 10 Å away from the center of the sheet. The system has 300 atoms.
