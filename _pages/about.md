The Oliveira Research Group uses computational chemistry, molecular modeling methods, and data science to investigate various materials as well as biomolecular systems. Currently, we are investigating the unfolding of knotted proteins, the interaction of gold nanocluster with biomolecules, the use of graphyne for water filtration, and the adsorption of water on yttria-stabilized zirconia [surfaces](https://www.mvnu.edu). View more details of our research [here](research.md)
