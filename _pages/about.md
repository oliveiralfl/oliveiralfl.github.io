The Oliveira Research Group uses computational chemistry, molecular modeling methods, and data science to investigate various materials as well as biomolecular systems. Currently, we are investigating the free energy surface of the unfolding of knotted proteins, the interaction of biomolecules with gold nanoclusters, the use of graphyne for water filtration, and the adsorption of water on yttria-stabilized zirconia surfaces.
